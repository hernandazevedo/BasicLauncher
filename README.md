# Basic Launcher

Basic Launcher is a simple Andoid home screen launcher application built from scratch for a youtube video tutorial series. In the GitHub repo, "S" stands for Series. So S1BasicLauncher goes to Series part 1 and S2BasicLauncher goes to Series part 2...etc. Each folder contains a zip which contains all of that part's source code.
